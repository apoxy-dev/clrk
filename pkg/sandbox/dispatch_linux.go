// DispatchRunsc hands off to gVisor's runsc entrypoint when the process
// was re-exec'd as a runsc subcommand. A host binary that drives this
// package's Manager must call DispatchRunsc() as the very first thing in
// main(), before any other initialization: the same /proc/self/exe is
// re-exec'd for every runsc create/start/kill/wait/delete and for the
// Sentry boot/gofer children, and those invocations must reach gVisor's
// maincli rather than the host's normal control loop.
//
// The runsc-exec helpers in this package put runsc-level flags (e.g.
// --root, --network) BEFORE the subcommand, mirroring the runsc CLI; so
// scan past leading flag-shaped argv tokens before checking for a known
// subcommand. maincli.Main never returns (cli.Run terminates via
// os.Exit), so this function only returns when argv contained no
// recognized subcommand at all — i.e. this is the host's primary
// invocation, not a re-exec.
