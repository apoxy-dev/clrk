	// InboundListenAddr opts the sandbox into the ingress path: the

	// init payload (InboundListenAddr + InboundFDIndex) before the Sentry
	// boots, and Start opens a host AF_UNIX listening socket fronting the
	// resident server, donating its fd so the in-Sentry inbound forwarder
	// can accept on it. The host socket path is surfaced on
	// [Instance.InboundSocket]. Unlike [Spec.Egress] this is tenant-neutral

	// into the sentrystack init payload and the in-Sentry control forwarder
	// accepts the dispatcher's connections on an in-stack listener and splices
	// each to the host control listener. Like InboundListenAddr this is
	// tenant-neutral and acted on by the core; unlike inbound it needs no fd
	// donation — the Sentry shares the host net namespace and dials the manager's
	// loopback control listener directly. Empty leaves the sandbox without a
